    "Great! We now have demonstrated that we are able to work with the database practically, using our previously made functions to load my music into the database, as well as to query based on certain features such as release date or genre. My next iteration of this project will be to make a user-driven component, such as generating a suggested album(s) based on user inputs. I will next tweak the organization of this project and create a script in order to achieve this."
